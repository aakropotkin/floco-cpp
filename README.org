This library contains C++ utilities for use in the
[[https://github.com/aakropotkin/floco][floco]] framework.

Currently this project is in early stages and is not in use by =floco=.

* Goals
** DONE Create a cached database for NPM registry fetches.
** STRT Migrate basic ~floco translate~ routines to C++.
** STRT Create a cached database for translated package metadata.
Cache metadata AS IS from ~floco translate~ without =foverrides= patches.
** TODO Create a cached database for source tree hashes.
** TODO Translate recursively for projects with =install= scripts.
** TODO Cache =semver= range checking, or port =semverSat= to C++.
** TODO Support workspaces.
** TODO Migrate /ideal tree/ formation routines to C++.
** TODO Migrate =checkSystemSupport= routine to C++.
Handle "!*" values.
** TODO Create an interactive tree editor.
A library such as =fzf=, =ranger=, or =ncurses= is a useful base.
