Currently this project is in early stages and is not in use by =floco=.

* Goals
** DONE Create a cached database for NPM registry fetches.
** STRT Create a cached database for translated package metadata.
** TODO Create a cached database for source tree hashes.
** TODO Migrate basic ~floco translate~ routines to C++.
** TODO Translate recursively for projects with =install= scripts.
** TODO Cache =semver= range checking, or port =semverSat= to C++.
** TODO Support workspaces.
** TODO Migrate /ideal tree/ formation routines to C++.
** TODO Create an interactive tree editor.
A library such as =fzf=, =ranger=, or =ncurses= is a useful base.
